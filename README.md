# Computer-Network

Programming Assignment 1:
Client using customized protocol on top of UDP protocol for sending information to the server.
One client connects to one server.

Reject error handling with sub code:
Case-1: An error message should be displayed on the screen when the received packet at server is not in sequence with expected packet from client; an error message should be generated by server and sent to client.

Case-2: The server receives a packet which its length field does not match the length of data in the payload field, an error message should be generated by server and sent to the client.

Case-3: The server receives a packet which does not have the End of Packet Identifier an error message should be generated by server and sent to the client

Program assignment 2:
Client using customized protocol on top of UDP protocol for requesting identification from server for access permission to the network.
One client connects to one server.

The client requests access information from server; the server will verify the validity of the request and will respond accordingly.
The communication between client and server will use the ack_timer, which was described in the first program assignment.
